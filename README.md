### Introduction

----------
Emotion recognition via facial expressions (ERFE) is a growing active research field in computer vision compared to other emotion channels, such as body actions and speech, primarily because superior expressive force and a larger application space is provided. 

### Overview
The facial expressions are grouped by the recognised emotions. The recognised emotions can be set visible
by clicking the corresponding check-box. The four different emotions are represented by four different colors.
